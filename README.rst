ABI Mapping Tools: Field Fitter docs example
============================================

Example workflow fitting continuous fields over a scaffold to discrete field values at data points.

Note that the data used in this example is synthetic i.e. made up for demonstration only, and it is fitted over a tricubic cube mesh. One of the data fields has time-varying parameters, and the example fits a time-varying continuous field to this data by fitting at each time step.
